# AssanBryantDev5Project

Self-directed month-long project based around figuring out how to upload .fpx files and play animations from said file. Project was set up with goals to meet but how to reach those goals, and the methods employed were all chosen by each individual with the purpose of teaching us how to figure out a new library without outside help and still achieve goals set towards us. Program is relatively simple, but all written from scratch with minimal prior knowledge on either .fbx or DirectX before starting, it simply loads an .fbx file in through a DLL, and then makes use of the data stored to create a skeleton, load a mesh for the skeleton, and play an animation through the skeleton that could latter be attached to it.

All Code contained was written by me Assan(Jon) Bryant
