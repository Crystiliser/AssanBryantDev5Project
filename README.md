# AssanBryantDev5Project
Self-directed project based around figuring out how to upload fpx files and play animations from said file. 
Project was set up with goals to meet such as loading in data, playing an animation, ect, but how and with
what were all learned and implemented on own. Program simply loads .fbx files in and parses out the position 
data of vertices for a skeleton, and for a mesh, then animates the skeleton in both step by step form, and twined. 

All Code contained was written by me
